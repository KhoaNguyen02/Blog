        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">March 1, 2022</h2>
        <h3>What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java ?</h3>
        <p>Object means a real-world entity, such as a table, ball, cow, etc. Object-oriented programming is a method for designing a program by using classes and objects. 
        It simplifies software maintenance and development by providing several concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Object</b>: An entity with state and behavior. For example bicycles, tables, chairs, etc. It can be physical or logical.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Class</b>: A collection of objects. It is a logical entity.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Inheritance</b>: When an object acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object, it is inheritance. This increases the reusability of the code. It is used to achieve polymorphism at runtime.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Polymorphism</b>: When a task is done in different ways is called polymorphism. For example, like drawing a rectangle or triangle, etc. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding for polymorphism. 
            Another example: the cat meows, and the dog barks gooooo.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Abstraction</b>: It is hiding the intrinsic details and showing the feature. For example, with a phone call, we don't know what the internal processing is like. In Java, they are using abstract class and abstract interface for abstraction.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Encapsulation</b>: It is binding code and data together into a single unit. For example, you may be familiar with the various capsules (or, more simply, laundry detergent sachets), the various tablets (detergent granules) that are packaged.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of OOP compared to POP (Procedure-oriented programming)</h3>
        <p>OOP makes it easier to design, develop and maintain while with procedural programming it is quite difficult to manage the code if the amount of code increases. 
        This increases the efficiency of the software development process.</p>
        <p>OOP provides Data Hiding whereas in procedural direction a global data can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
        <p>OOP gives you the ability to simulate real-world events more efficiently. We can provide solutions to real world problems if we use Object Oriented Programming.</p>
